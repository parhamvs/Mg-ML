# Materials Science Data Analysis

This repository contains Python code for materials science data analysis using machine learning techniques to predict material properties, including Ultimate Tensile Strength (UTS), Yield Strength (YS), and Elongation (EL), based on element composition.

## Overview

- **Data Loading**: Load data from the Excel file.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Calculate sums for element groups, encode features, and split data.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Train Random Forest Regressors for UTS, YS, and EL.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assess model performance and visualize property distributions.
- **SHAP Analysis**: Explain feature importance using SHAP values.
- **Permutation Importance**: Evaluate feature importance through permutation.
- **Alternative Models**: Compare alternative regression models.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Analyze feature correlations.
- **Partial Dependence Plots**: Visualize feature effects on UTS.
- **Repository Structure**: Includes a Jupyter Notebook, data folder, and requirements.
- **License**: MIT License for educational and research use.
