# Code Overview

## Introduction
This repository contains Python code for a data analysis and machine learning project. The code performs the following tasks:

- Importing necessary libraries.
- Loading a dataset from an Excel file.
- Performing feature engineering to create new features.
- Training a Random Forest Regressor model.
- Evaluating the model's performance using metrics.
- Visualizing feature importance using permutation importance and SHAP values.

## Dependencies
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- scikit-learn
- shap

## Getting Started
Clone this repository to your local machine to get started.

## Data
The code assumes a dataset in an Excel file named `Mg-GA-Added.xlsx`.

## Feature Engineering
The code creates new features based on the sum of various columns in the dataset.

## Data Preparation
Encode categorical variables if needed and separate the target variable from features.

## Model Training
A Random Forest Regressor model is trained for prediction.

## Model Evaluation
The code evaluates the model's performance using R-squared, MAE, and RMSE metrics.

## Feature Importance
Visualize feature importance using permutation importance.

## SHAP Analysis
Calculate SHAP values and visualize their summary plot for understanding feature impacts.

Feel free to adapt and extend this code for your specific dataset and tasks.
